# Academic Performance Analysis Project

This project analyzes academic performance data from university students. It demonstrates a complete data workflowâ€”from data extraction and transformation using SQL, through data organization, to interactive visualizations in Power BI.

## Overview

The dataset includes academic performance data with fields such as:
- **CGPA100, CGPA200, CGPA300, CGPA400:** Cumulative GPAs at different academic stages.
- **SGPA:** Semester-wise GPA.
- **Prog Code:** Academic program identifier.
- **YoG:** Year of Graduation.
- **Gender:** Student gender.

SQL scripts in the **SQL** folder were used to extract, transform, and analyze the data. The final interactive dashboard built in Power BI (located in the **PowerBI** folder) visualizes key performance indicators, trends over time, and comparisons between male and female students.

## How to Use

1. **Dataset:**  
   - Review the dataset file(s) in the `Dataset` folder.

2. **SQL Scripts:**  
   - Open the SQL file(s) in the `SQL` folder to see the queries used for data extraction and transformation.

3. **Power BI Dashboard:**  
   - Open the Power BI (.pbix) file in the `PowerBI` folder using Power BI Desktop to explore the interactive visualizations and KPIs.

## Key Insights

- **Gender Trends:**  
  Female students demonstrate higher academic improvement compared to male students across most programs.  
- **Program Specifics:**  
  While overall improvement favors female students, the CIS program is an exception where male performance is higher.  
- **Population Differences:**  
  Despite a larger number of male students, the performance metrics tend to favor female students.

## Future Work

- Incorporate additional demographic or behavioral data for deeper analysis.
- Enhance dashboard interactivity with more detailed drill-downs.
- Explore advanced statistical models to predict future performance trends.
